# Suggest Post Tags

The Suggest Post Tags plugin helps you reduce the amount of tags you are using by suggesting similar, existing tags.

## How it works

Using an API, the terms you search for are looked up and compared to your existing post tags. If you have a post tag which matches one of the related words found, it will be suggested.
